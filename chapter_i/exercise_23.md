2.  Absorbency / absorbent. This associative looks fine.

3.  Marketing / markets. This associative looks not relevant because markets refer to place, while marketing refer to job function.

4.  University / universe. This associative clearly not relevant, because term universe has general meaning while term university refers to place.

5.  Volume / volumes. This associative looks really good.
